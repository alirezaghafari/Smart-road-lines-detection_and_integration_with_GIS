# Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my bachelor's thesis project at Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran. The project focuses on the automated detection of road lines using smartphone-based camera and motion data, and the integration of these lines into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for enhanced road management and autonomous vehicle navigation. The approach leverages a deep learning model to detect road lines from videos, processes and filters the detected lines, and visualizes them on a map, providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for urban infrastructure monitoring.
